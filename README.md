# DSA210-Project

### DESCRIPTION 
I am Ozan Okan(30961). In this project, the goal is to explore the relationship between my personal health measurements, weather conditions and geographical conditions of the cities that I visited in the past year. This project will analyze how location and environmental factors affect my activity levels. To find significant patterns, the results will be visualized using statistical methods and exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques.

### DATA
In this project, i will be using my health data, collected from my apple health, weather data and geographical informations will be collected from APIs through scraping. To make the analysis easier, the data will be aligned by date and time in an excell file.

### WEBSITES
I will be using OpenWeatherMap API (https://openweathermap.org/) and that kind of sites related to the weather conditions.

### EDA 
Finding patterns, correlations, and anomalies in the data will require summarizing and visualizing it as part of EDA. Trends like how temperature or humidity affects activity levels will be examined using scatter plots, line charts etc. Also, in some situations data will be grouped in order to compare variations.

### TOOLS
Python - programming language for data analysis/
Pandas - For data cleaning and manipulation/
Matplotlib - For data visualization/
Jupyter Notebooks - For documenting and executing the analysis process./
etc.


### EXPECTED OUTCOMES
This project's objective is to investigate how weather and city environments impact health metrics. Finding connections between weather and health behaviors, revealing patterns (seasonal, regional, etc.), and figuring out how routines are impacted by travel may all be part of the expected outcomes. Additionally, the analysis may offer personalized recommendations for sustaining consistent well-being across various climates and cities, as well as predictive insights, such as how particular weather conditions affect physical activity.

### LIMITATIONS
Incomplete or missing data could limit the study, particularly when it comes to meteorological conditions unique to a location. Additionally, the project might not account for other factors influencing health, such as stress, work schedules, or diet. Sampling bias and the limited duration of one year may also impact the generalizability of findings.
