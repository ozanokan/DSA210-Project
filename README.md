I am Ozan Okan(30961). In this project, my aim is to explore the reliationship between my personal health metrics, weather conditions and geographical conditions.  The project will analyze how location and environmental factors affect activity levels, sleep  and general health through analyzing data gathered over the previous 12 months. To find significant patterns, the results will be visualized using statistical methods and exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques.
