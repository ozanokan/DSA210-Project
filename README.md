# DSA210-Project

## DESCRIPTION 
I am Ozan Okan(30961). In this project, my aim is to explore the reliationship between my personal health metrics, weather conditions and geographical conditions.  The project will analyze how location and environmental factors affect activity levels, sleep  and general health through analyzing data gathered over the previous 12 months. To find significant patterns, the results will be visualized using statistical methods and exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques.

## DATA
In this project, i will be using my health data, collected from my apple health, weather data from APIs, and geographical informations of the cities that i have been in the past year. To make the analysis easier, the data will be aligned by date and time in an excell file.

## WEBSITES
I will be using OpenWeatherMap API and that kind of sites related to the weather conditions.

## EDA 
Finding patterns, correlations, and anomalies in the data will require summarizing and visualizing it as part of EDA. Trends like how temperature or humidity affects activity levels will be examined using scatter plots, line charts etc. In order to compare regional variations in health metrics under various weather conditions, data will also be grouped by city.
